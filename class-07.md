# Tables 
A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes. Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

The < table > element is used to add tables to a web page.
A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the < tr > element.
Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the < td > element (or < th > if it is a header).
You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >,< tbody >, and  < tfoot >.



# Functions, Methods, and Objects 
Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects. (There are several ways to create objects.)
The object is the curly braces and their contents.
The object is stored in a variable called hotel. so you would refer to it as the hotel object.
Separate each key from its value using a colon Separate each property and method with a comma (but not after the last value).

An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
