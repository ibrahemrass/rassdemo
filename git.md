# GIT
* Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot
of the file and stores a reference to it. 
If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it

* > Tracking Changes

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.


> Files in Git can reside in three main states

- committed 
- modified
- stage
