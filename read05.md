# operators and loops
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. 
* Comparison Operators
JavaScript language includes operators that compare two operands and return Boolean value true or false.
==	Compares the equality of two operands without considering type.
===	Compares equality of two operands with type.
!=	Compares inequality of two operands.
>	Checks whether left side value is greater than right side value. If yes then returns true otherwise false.
<	Checks whether left operand is less than right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.
>=	Checks whether left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.
<=	Checks whether left operand is less than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.
# loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for - loops through a block of code a number of times. for/in - loops through the properties of an object. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

- the main difference between main and while the structer of each loop 
the secound one is when i dont know ho many time the loop is
