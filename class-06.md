# opjects
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. 
 
property is a variable is part of an object

method is  a function is part of an object



# DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.  


THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes. 
- THE DOCUMENT NODE 
- ELEMENT NODES 
- ATTRIBUTE NODES 
- TEXT NODES 


* U CAN LOOP THROUGH A NODELIST




ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION 
DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page (rather than
i nnerHTML). It involves three steps
- CREATE THE ELEMENT   createEl ement ()  
- GIVE IT CONTENT      createTextNode() 
- ADD IT TO THE DOM    appendChild()  





REMOVING ELEMENTS VIA DOM MANIPULATION 
DOM manipulation can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree. 
- STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE 
- STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE 
- REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTA INING ELEMENT
