### HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption
- Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new  < figure > element to
contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. You can have more than one
image inside the < figure > element as long as they all share the same caption  



- The < figcaption > element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no way to
associate an < img > element with its caption.

weight, style, and spacing
