* Headers & Footers 
The < header > and < footer > elements can be used for:
-The main header or footerthat appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
 A header or footer for an individual < article > or < section >  within the page.


 * Navigation 
 The < nav > element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

* Articles 
The < article > element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

* Asides 
if its inside the artical element , it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to it 
if its out side the artical element , it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page

* Sections 

The < section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading

* Heading Groups
 the purpose of the < hgroup >element is to group together a set of one or more < h1 > through < h6 > elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.
