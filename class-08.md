# css Layout
* The layout it is a collection of  layouts and patterns made with CSS.
* normal flow
 In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: position: static; I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.

* relative postitioning
position:relative: moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. You can indicate that an element should be relatively positioned using the position property with a value of relative.

* absolute possitioning
When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normalflow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is notthere.)

* Fixed Positioning
 Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
