# Charts 
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create. 

* we can create charts by   Chart.js,  
a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single < canvas > node to render the chart.

In this example, we create a bar chart for a single dataset and render that in our page
