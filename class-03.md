# lists
there are three types of list
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Definition lists


- Ordered Lists 
The ordered list is created with the 'ol' element.
and eche item will be between 'li' tags

- unordared list 
is created by 'ul' element and eche item will be between 'li' tags

- definition list  
are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. 
created by 'di' element  and inside this element we hava a 'dt' tags that is the name of the consipt we want to defin 
and 'dd' tags This is used to contain the definition

# boxes 
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes
we can change the Box Dimensions height and width 
and we can limeted width and height 
by min-width-height  or max-width-height

- Overflowing contant 
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have
one of two values
- hidden  will hides any text that dors not fit in the box 
- scroll will add a scroll tool to allow the uesr to see the text by scrolling 

* Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance
1 Border
2 Margin 
3 Padding
 
The padding and margin properties are very helpful
to add space between the items  the page 

# we can ues css on boxes to mack them as we like 

# ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
- VALU ES IN ARRAYS 
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 


# if eles statment

if true it will run the first code 
if fales it will run the secound one


# switch statment
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the
code that should run if the variable matches that value

operators and loops
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

Comparison Operators JavaScript language includes operators that compare two operands and return Boolean value true or false. == Compares the equality of two operands without considering type. === Compares equality of two operands with type. != Compares inequality of two operands.
Checks whether left side value is greater than right side value. If yes then returns true otherwise false. < Checks whether left operand is less than right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false. = Checks whether left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false. <= Checks whether left operand is less than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.

loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for - loops through a block of code a number of times. for/in - loops through the properties of an object. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

the main difference between main and while the structer of each loop the secound one is when i dont know ho many time the loop is
